        "## Question - 1\n",
        "Develop a Python function named **online_order_finite_state_machine**. This function will be part of a class named **onlineOrderFSM**, which tracks the state of an online order process through an attribute **current_state**. The function adjusts the **current_state** based on the inputs it receives, which are two boolean variables **place_order** and **cancel_order**, and a list of tuples named **transition_state_tuple_list**. Each tuple within this list outlines a specific transition between order states, where the first element of the tuple represents the current state and the second element represents the state to transition into if certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transition logic works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The **transition_state_tuple_list** might be predefined with values such as `[(\"ORDER\", \"PAID\"), (\"PAID\", \"FULFILLED\"), (\"FULFILLED\", None)]`.\n",
        "   - Each tuple indicates a progression from one order state to the next. For example, from **\"ORDER\"** to **\"PAID\"**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. When the function is invoked:\n",
        "   - If **current_state** is **None** and **place_order** is set to **True**, the state transitions to **\"ORDER\"**.\n",
        "   - If **current_state** is **\"ORDER\"**, regardless of whether **place_order** is **True** or **False**, the next state becomes **\"PAID\"**.\n",
        "   - If **cancel_order** is **True** at any point, the state resets to **None**, canceling the order process.\n",
        "   - After moving to **\"PAID\"**, without considering the value of **place_order**, the state progresses to **\"FULFILLED\"**.\n",
        "   - Similarly, if the order process reaches **\"FULFILLED\"**, the next state will be **None**, effectively indicating the completion or cancellation of the process.\n",
        "   - Again, if **cancel_order** is set to **True** while in **\"FULFILLED\"**, **current_state** would reset to **None**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This systematic handling of order states allows the function to control the flow of the order process dynamically based on user actions like placing or canceling the order.\n",
        "**Conditions to follow:**\n",
        "- The output should be a string format similar to test cases mentioned below\n",
        "- Inbuilt functions which require no import and Datatype methods can be used to solve this problem but No arbitray functions or library can be used.\n",
